ScopedAssociations
==================

Use your named scopes to add conditions to associations! Keep your code DRY and allows eager loading of scoped associations.

Currently this only works for has_many associations, and probably only on Rails 2.2.

Example
=======

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :published_posts, :scope => :published
  has_many :published_and_approved_posts, :scope => [:published, :approved]
end

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  named_scope :published, :conditions => { :published => true }
  named_scope :approved, :conditions => { :approved => true }
end

Install
=======

./script_plugin install git://github.com/kristopher/scoped-associations.git
